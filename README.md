# Battle Royale
It is a survival game that I developed with Python 3.7 in my spare time. This project was created with pygame and socket modules.


# Required:
- Python 3.x
- pygame
- socket


# TO MAKE THIS CODE WORK...
You will need to change the server address from within the following two files:
- client.py
- server.py

You will also need to run server.py on some kind of server. After that you can launch game.py


# Known Bugs:
- No known bugs, if you find any bugs or have anything to contribute feel free to open an issue.
